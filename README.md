# Pen-in-the-air

In the given project, my aim was to create a *virtual canvas* that will enable you to write in the air, thus naming it ‘Pen in the Air’. Using the Computer Vision libraries in python like cv2 and mediapipe, this project consists of two python(.py) files namely *pen-in-the-air.py* and *htm.py*. The project has been made using Python version 3.8 and the required libraries were installed using pip version 21.1.2 with the IDE called Pycharm. The folder *Header images* consists six images that is used to display tools. The canvas has an Eraser and 5 coloured Pens which will allow you to erase and write with the respective colours. 

### How to use-
- Use 2 fingers (Index and Middle) to go to selection mode and select the tool in the header image.
- Use 1 finger (Index) for drawing mode and write on the canvas with the color pen you selected.
- Run the program with your palm opened in front of the camera as a prerequisite.
- Try to keep your palm in the window for the functions to detect it continuously otherwise it will terminate with an error.
- You can also press the ‘q’ key to close the window when done.
